      "question": "Why car-pooling is perceived as a sustainable transportation method?",
      "answer": "Car-pooling enables people to drive together - thus it replaces the CO2 emissions usually done by multiple vehicles to the emissions done by only one."

      "question": "Do buying carbon offsets means you travel sustainably?",
      "answer": "Yes...but no! Offsets, no matter how good their stories can sound, tend to be unregulated and can vary substantially in quality, often manipulating the numbers of CO2 emissions."
