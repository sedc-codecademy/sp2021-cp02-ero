      "question": "How to reduce the CO2 emissions produced by food?",
      "answer": "Food from outside of your local area needs to be transported by boat, plane, or truck. That means the greater the distance, the more greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions enter the atmosphere with each shipment. So, local food is generally more sustainable than food that was produced in a different continent or country."
